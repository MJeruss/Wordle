# Wordle

  This GUI project uses the Model–View–Controller (MVC) software design pattern. 

  models.py - the model
  
  views.py - the view
  
  wordy.py - the controller
  
  The settings.json file allows for quick changes to the game including length of word, color options, window size, and more. 

  The two additional files - long_wordlist.txt and short_wordlist.txt - are the possible words to be guessed.
